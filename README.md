# SMTPClient
This is a simple implementation of a SMTP-client written as a part of the course 62577 Data Communication on DTU. The requirements for this is assigment is that it is written using sockets and raw communication between client and server-side.

This client is able to send emails using smtp.gmail.com over TLS but to authenticate you need to allow access for less secure apps. This is due to the way google have implemented their security.

# Prereq
* A Gmail account
* Python 3.6.+
